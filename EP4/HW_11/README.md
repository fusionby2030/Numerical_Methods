# HW_11

## Problems

1.  Splitting of the spectral lines corresponding to the transition1D2â†’1F3isdetected in a magnetic field with B= 1 T. Normal or anomalous Zeeman effect will be observed?
2.  Does the 4D1/2 term split in a magnetic field?  
3.  Splitting  due  to  the  spin-orbit  coupling  between  the  62P1/2 and  62P3/2 states leads to a difference of 422 angstrom for the first pair of the prime series.  The shorter wavelength is 8521 angstrom. Calculate the spin-orbit splitting - a.  
4.  Derive the selection rules for the quantum harmonic oscillator.
