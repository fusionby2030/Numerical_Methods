# HW_05

## Problems

1. A  hydrogen  atom,  which  initially  was  at  rest,  emits  a  photon  with  the frequency corresponding to the transition from the first excited state to the ground state.  Find the velocity of the atom after emission.

2. Positronium  is  a  system  composed  of  an  electron  and  its  antiparticle positron, which are rotating about the center of mass of the system.  The positron has an electric charge of +1 e and has the same mass as an electron.  Find the energy levels for positronium.  

3. Recall  the  velocity  selector  used  by  Otto  Stern  to  measure  the  velocity distribution.  A similar setup is used to obtain a monochro-matic beam of neutrons, in which the discs, each containing one hole, are shifted by an angle *phi*.  The distance between the discs is *L*, the distance from the hole to the disc axis is *R*, the hole diameter is *a*.  Find the deBroglie wavelength selected by such selector and its dispersion, if the discs are rotated with the angular frequency *omega*.

4. An  average  time  an  atom  exists  in  an  excited  state  is  10âˆ’9s.   Upon emitting photon with a wavelength of 600 nm, the atom relaxes back to the ground state.  Find the minimal width _v_ of the emission spectral line measured at this wavelength.

### Code Comments

Sadly no code was used here, and all problems were done by hand. There is a future plan of implementing a simulation for the Otto Stern problem, but I have not had time to complete it.
