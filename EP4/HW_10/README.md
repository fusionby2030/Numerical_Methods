# HW_10

## Problems

1.  Consider the first spectral line of the Lyman series for hydrogen atom.  By taking account of the spin-orbit coupling,  find the splitting of the spectral line.  Note that the selection rules (not yet covered) allows only transitions with delta L = +-1
2. Find the average value of the scalar product of the total magnetic moment and the total angular momentum.
3. Estimate  the  smallest  possible  angular  velocity  for  a  spherically-C 60 fullerene molecule.  The van-der-Waals diameter assume to be 1.1 nm
4.  Find  how  the  spin-orbit  coupling  will  affect  the  energy  level  of  the d-orbital.  Represent your final answer as a diagram similar to Figure 1.53 in the lecture notes.
