# Numerical Methods Study Guide

I finally found a use for this repository! To help prepare for exam, I will point out the main themes we learned from the exercises.

I start by dividing the different topics we learned into the following directories. Who knows maybe this becomes a package.

- Root Finding (_roots_)
- Derivatives (_derivatives_)
- Integral Approximations (_integrals_)
- Polynomial Approximations/Interpolation (_interpawho_)
- Binary (_bynary_) *TBD*
- Least Square Methods (_not_so_ML_) *TBD*
