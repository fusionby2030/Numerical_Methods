# Lectures on Python in Economics
This started as a lecture on Statistical Analysis with python, but is now [27.07.20] being turned into a series of lectures, as a friend of mine working in the field of finance wanted to learn more how she can use python in her work. We start again at the basics of programming and move from there, as to inspire the intuition in problem solving via programming. Each week is divided into folders which contain the slides, programs, and exercise solutions for each week. I use many open source resources and the documentation sporadically, but try to give credit in the slides for the information I learn/use from the web.

## Week One: What is programming?
- Brief history of problem solving
  - [Banu Musa Brothers 9th Century Programmable flute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban%C5%AB_M%C5%ABs%C4%81)
  - [Al-Kindi](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Kind%C4%AB#Kryptologie)
  - IBM-600 Calculator
- Current state of programming
  - functional steps
  - process of writing code to output (Text editor vs IDE)
- Example of Economic problem to solve with programming
  - Find the best price to sell a good based (demand)
  - sample code found in _supply_demand_
- Next steps
  - Aimed to learn more about what my friend was interested in. We decided to jump into examples was maybe best approach.

## Week Two: Getting to know Python
- Transition from Binary -> Assembler -> High Level Languages
- Logic _logic.py_
  - AND 
  - OR 
  - NOT 
  - XOR 
- Creating a virtual world 
  - Basic Python Data Types _various-types-of-data.py_
  - Immutable vs Mutable 
  - Iterable vs Noniterable 
  - Libraries (Heavy Lifting)
- Overview of the Steps of Programming Today 
  - Interacting with the outside world
  - Preperation 
  - Transformation (Statistical Analysis) 
  - Modeling and Computation (Connecting Data to Models) 
  - Presentation of Results

## Week Three Getting our hands dirty: 
- [Operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) on Python Data types
